## Introduction

The AMO project seeks to create a framework for optimizing the motion of humanoid robots. As robots become more integrated into our daily lives, ensuring they can move in a fluid and adaptive manner is crucial. This project leverages advanced algorithms to enhance the control of hyper-dexterous humanoids.

## Features

- **Adaptive Control**: The system can adjust its movements based on environmental feedback.
- **Whole-Body Coordination**: Achieves synchronized motion across all limbs for natural movement.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Processes input and adjusts movements instantly for smooth operation.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplifies interaction with the system for developers and researchers.
